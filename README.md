# PleaseBSOD
A BSOD editor made in Python :3


###############################
EXTRA INFO
###############################

You need to put the BSOD Folder(yes the whole folder) to the C Drive
You need to put your please.bat to system32 if you want it to work like a native windows command
It has optional shutdown toggle in the editor if wanted
if you want to get rid of it just press Ctrl+Shift+Q
thanks for using my bs <3
